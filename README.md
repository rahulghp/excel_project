# Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard


## Introduction
Bank loans are a crucial financial tool that enables individuals and businesses to achieve their goals and manage financial needs. However, it's essential for borrowers to understand the terms, costs, and responsibilities associated with loans to make informed financial decisions.

In order to monitor and assess bank's lending activities and performance, need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help to make data-driven decisions, track loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform lending strategies.



## Problem Statement
#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

1.Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

2.Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial so should keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

3.Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment therefor should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

4.Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into lending portfolio's overall cost.

5.Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us geuss their financial health so need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

6.Good Loan v Bad Loan KPIâ€™s
In order to evaluate the performance of customer lending activities and assess the quality of customer loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria.

Good Loan KPIs:
- Good Loan Application Percentage: Need to calculate the percentage of loan applications classified as 'Good Loans.' This category includes loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'
- Good Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications falling under the 'Good Loan' category, which consists of loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'
- Good Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Good Loans.' This includes the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'
- Good Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers for 'Good Loans,' which encompasses all payments made on loans with a loan status of 'Fully Paid' and 'Current.'

Bad Loan KPIs:

- Bad Loan Application Percentage: Calculating the percentage of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans.' This category specifically includes loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'
- Bad Loan Applications: Identifying the total number of loan applications categorized as 'Bad Loans,' which consists of loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'
- Bad Loan Funded Amount: Determining the total amount of funds disbursed as 'Bad Loans.' This comprises the principal amounts of loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'
- Bad Loan Total Received Amount: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers for 'Bad Loans,' which includes all payments made on loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'

#### Loan Status Grid View
In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our    lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.' This report will serve as a valuable tool for analysing and understanding the key indicators associated with different loan statuses. By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and    assess the health of our loan portfolio.

7. Monthly Trends by Issue Date:
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded     Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

Objective: This visuals will showcase how 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received' vary over time, allowing us to identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.

8. Regional Analysis by State:
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

Geographic Regions: States

Objective: This filled map will visually represent lending metrics categorized by state, enabling us to identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.

9. Loan Term Analysis:
Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

Segments: Loan Terms (e.g., 36 months, 60 months)

Objective: This donut chart will depict loan statistics based on different loan terms, allowing us to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

10. Employee Length Analysis:

Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

Objective: This bar chart will illustrate how lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.

 11. Loan Purpose Breakdown:

Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

Objective: This bar chart will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.

12. Home Ownership Analysis:

Metrics: 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' and 'Total Amount Received'

Objective: This tree map will display loan metrics categorized by different home ownership statuses, allowing for a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
